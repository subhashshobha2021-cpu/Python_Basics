        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "Ans:Function argument and parameters are fundament concept of in python functions\n",
        "Arguments are the actual values passed when functions is called and parameter is defined as the place holder and what it it expecting\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "Ans. Methods are also part of the family functions but the specific difference them is methods are functions which are defined for particular class of objects\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "Ans. There are 2 ways to call a function\n",
        "l. \"def\" method\n",
        "ll. \"Lambda\" method\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "Ans. \"return\" statement is used to exit the function/code and also, it can be used to get the specified value while stoppong the code\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "An iterable is a python object used to return its member sequentally, and iterator is the variable who represnt the stream of data\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "Generator concept is used to get the cumulative result instantly, like we are running a code to sum the object one by one, so it will provide sum of its list instantly. Also used to save memory space in working of function\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "Benefits of Generator function:\n",
        "# It has higher speed as compared to regular function\n",
        "# It does not store data on every iteration\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "Ans. Lambda is actually known as the shorthand funaction and it helps us to write multiple lines codes in a single line\n",
        "It is used to write a code in very crisp way\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "Map function works as an iterator to return as result when applied to certain values like lists, tuple and set\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter() functions in Python?\n",
        "Map function works as an iterator to return as result when applied to certain values like lists, tuple and set\n",
        "Reduce is used to save memory space and give the result in combine when, it applies on list and any other data set, it does not store every iteration but gives the final result\n",
        "Filter function is used to get the selected data based on certain condition\n",
        "\n",
