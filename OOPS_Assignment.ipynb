        "What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP is the concept in programming where you can create a seperate code which is known as class and create object which will be reusable.\n",
        "It means that we are creating a specific code which can be re-used multiple times in a particular class.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is a class in OOP+\n",
        "\n",
        "Class is known as blueprint or template to create objects in OOPS. It also used to define the properties of the object available.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is an object in OOP+\n",
        "\n",
        "Object is simply the code written in OOP which will be called upon to re-use whenever it is required\n",

        "What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction is the concept to hide the complex/unrequired code and showing the required code\n",
        "Encapsulation is the proprty of object where we can hide the method/code and we can do it 2 option:\n",
        "1. __ making it private\n",
        "2_ making it protected\n",
        "\n",
        "What are dunder methods in Python?\n",

        "Dunder methods are the built-in methods in python. they are also known as magic methods. Ex- __init__ is dunder method\n",
        "\n",
        "Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "The word inheritance means that getting the similarity of someone. In OOPS, intheritance refers to the method when 1 functions inherited the property of another function as child\n",

        "\n",
        "What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",

        "What is method overloading in Python?\n",

        "\n",
        "What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Method overriding is the concept where same function has been written in different classes or methods. It will take the property of the parent class\n",
        "\n",
        "What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) advantages include better code organization (modularity, encapsulation), reusability via inheritance, flexibility through polymorphism, easier maintenance and debugging, improved security, and scalability, all by modeling real-world entities as self-contained \"objects\". This leads to less redundant code, faster development, and more robust, manageable software, especially for large systems.\n",

        "What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",

        "\n",
        "Inheritance is concept where a function is taking the property of his parent class. When a class inheriting the property of multiple classes. It is known as multiple inheritance\n",

        "\n",
        "Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "If a class defines __repr__ but not __str__, str() and print() will fall back to using the output of __repr__. However, if __str__ is defined, it is always preferred for human-facing output [1]. It is considered a best practice to always define __repr__ for custom classes, as it provides valuable debugging information, and defining __str__ is optional but recommended for user-friendly output\n",

        "\n",
        "What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "The super() function in Python is a built-in function primarily used in object-oriented programming to grant access to methods and properties of a parent or sibling class\n",
        "\n",
        "What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "The __del__ method in Python, also known as the destructor, defines the code to be executed when an instance of a class is about to be destroyed (garbage collected). Its primary significance lies in allowing objects to perform necessary cleanup operations before their memory is reclaimed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "Class methods are bound to the class for accessing/modifying the functions where static methods bevaves like a plan function and does not take \"Self\" as input\n",

        "\n",
        "How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "In Python, polymorphism with inheritance is primarily achieved through method overriding, a form of runtime polymorphism (also known as dynamic binding)\n",
        "\n",
        "What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "Method chaining is an object-oriented programming (OOP) technique that allows you to call multiple methods on the same object in a single, sequential line of code. Each method in the chain performs an action and then returns the object itself (usually self), allowing the next method to be called on that returned object without the need for intermediate variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "The purpose of the __call__ method in Python is to make an instance of a class callable, meaning it can be treated and invoked like a function"
